    description: The 4WW3 Project is a website that allows users to browse and contribute reviews of geographically based destinations. The website utilizes a combination of technologies to provide a seamless user experience. The front-end of the website is built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, which are used to create the layout, styling and interactive features of the website. On the back-end, the website utilizes PHP to handle server-side tasks such as user authentication and data management. Additionally, the website uses .htaccess to accept php for secure user authorization and Git for version control. The site also uses Jquery and Bootstrap for responsive design and has some animations implemented using animate.css.
  - name: "Python Custom Compiler"
    git_url: "https://github.com/parsaabadi/Compiler-Final-Version"
    description: The project involved modifying a pre-existing P0 Compiler to include new features such as universal quantifiers, array builders, set builders, and existential quantifiers. These extensions were implemented by modifying files located in the src folder and adding new files required to extend the original P0 compiler capabilities. These new features allow for the use of quantified expressions in the P0 language, similar to those found in languages like Python, where they can be implemented through external libraries or custom designs. The project aims to enhance the P0 compiler's capabilities by adding support for universal and existential quantifiers, array builders, and set builders.
  - name: "SprayPost"
    git_url: "https://github.com/parsaabadi/Startup"
    description: Spray Post is an innovative communication app that allows users to connect with others in close proximity using a custom engine, Swift, and cloud services. It uses location-based services to identify nearby users and enables real-time communication through text, audio, and video messages, and even voice and video calls.

    description: "Led the team in maintaining and regularly updating documentations for pods using JIRA. I also collected user requirements for building and maintaining code for tools, and applied principles of safety engineering to software development in a model-driven environment. This resulted in a boost of 10% development efficiency through testing for bugs. I conducted regular team meetings to share project status, issues, and ideas, rapidly prototyped new capabilities to confirm feasibility, and deployed inter-device communications such as SPI, I2C, and UART. Additionally, I re-designed the auto-layout system for the framework resulting in 20% better readability for testing software.
